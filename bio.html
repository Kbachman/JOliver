               I love to sing, write and perform. Music is my outlet for feelings and emotions I cannot otherwise express. I know everyone has been through pain in his or her own life. I've been hurt by people very close to me, but the one person who has never hurt me is the same person who conquered the grave (Romans 8:11). And that same power lives in me and all who believe.
            </p>
            <p>
               Though I have been through pain, I have also experienced amazing joy and blessings in my life; but the scars remain. You can preceive a scar as just a blemish or understand that without it you would not be who you are today. We are all created unique with a designed purpose. I encourage you to learn what you can from the people around you and respect the people who have helped you along the way.
            </p>
            <p>
               My story has nothing to do with me but everything to do with God. My mission is not about trying to make you like me, rather me giving you an opportunity to hear and experience a story that transformed my life.
            </p>
            <p>
               It has taken me a long time to truly believe that I am worthy of anything let alone hold the power to impact the people around me with my music and the gift I have freely been given. I hope you will be inspired and believe in yourself and know the value you posses. Thank you for listening!
