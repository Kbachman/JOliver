 Artist’s Statement 

The idea of painting sinking ships was one of those three in the morning, half‐awake kinds of ideas. While I was researching images, I came across pictures of ships that were being sunk deliberately, in many cases for the purpose of creating reefs. I was struck by the nature of these images. Rather than the noisy drama and turbulence one would normally associate with maritime disasters, there seemed to me to be an atmosphere of calm and a quality of subdued quiet to the events. I felt an element of resignation and acceptance in these ships. 

I wanted to paint them in that way: calm and with a sense of graceful abdication. I chose to paint them with the sampler‐like backgrounds to emphasize this, and to make them feel homey and normal, even comfortable. I envisioned them to be like a collection of portraits in the hallway of a home. 

As an artist I am focused on the act of painting itself and the medium I primarily work with is encaustic (beeswax, resins and pigment). I love the physical quality of painting and I find encaustic to be the most satisfying. It is tactile and sensuous and has a wonderful density which is amenable to the additive and subtractive techniques that I employ. 

My thanks go to Laurel Cain, John Lammon and Bruce Warshaw for help with this project.
